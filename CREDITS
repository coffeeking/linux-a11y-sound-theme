#I would like to thank the following people, who were instrumental in the linux accessibility sound theme
Thanks first to Simon Idelginger, who gave me the contact details for Freeky Fwoof, who has an archive of sounds from which I got a lot of the sounds for this theme
Next thanks goes to canonical LTD http://www.ubuntu.com who made the log in and log out sounds I use.
Next thanks goes to Michael Curran and Jamie Teh of the NVDA project <http://www.nvaccess.org> for the sounds for check boxes, buttons, expanders and so on.
Also thanks goes to billy wolf AKA storm dragon, who maintains the tintin alteraeon and tintin kallisti mud packs, from which I got a few of the sounds.
Lastly, but definitely not least, the folks behind the freedesktop project. Without them I never would've been able to have sounds for terminal bell, and also the sound specifications. Those were instrumental in making such a high quality sound theme.
